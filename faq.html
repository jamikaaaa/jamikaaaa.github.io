faq:
  - question: Why do shoppers use your service?
    answer: >-
      Our customers use our service when they're shopping across the border and
      the retailer can't physically ship to them, or when they're away from home
      (out of town, on holiday, etc.) and would like to safeguard their package.
      Not everybody has access to a PO Box, so that's where we come in!
  - question: 'For domestic orders, why not just use a PO Box?'
    answer: >-
      Not everybody has access to a PO Box. Also, regarding storing packages in
      the post office, they are notorious for losing packages so that's why
      shoppers come to us for a safe and speedy delivery.
  - question: 'How does this work, exactly?'
    answer: >-
      We will connect you with a shopper (this is done on our end) and they will
      ship their order to your home address. You'll then ship their package to
      them directly, or to their friends/family, and be paid generously for it.
  - question: What will I need to do this job?
    answer: 'Just a printer to print shipping labels, scissors, and tape.'
  - question: Will I have to pay for shipping?
    answer: >-
      Nope! All shipping costs will always be covered by us, and prepaid labels
      will always be provided for you. Simply drop off your package(s) or call
      for pickup (most post offices offer this service for free), and get paid.
  - question: How long does this job take?
    answer: >-
      30 minutes, or up to 1 hour per drop-off. It's actually quite a simple and
      quick job. Leave all the work to us, ship the package, and get paid.
  - question: Why is the pay so high?
    answer: >-
      In order to ensure the highest quality of service as well as to discourage
      theft, we pay each and every single forwarder with a starting salary of
      $30 per package shipped.
  - question: Can I check the contents of the package I'll be shipping?
    answer: >-
      Absolutely! All our items are shipped from major retailers such as
      Walmart, Target, Best Buy, etc. as well as major suppliers, so they are
      fully compliant with the law.
  - question: My package came under a different person's name.
    answer: >-
      This is actually by design. Your package will come under your shopper's
      name, so you don't confuse packages when you have several to ship out.
  - question: Is there a dashboard to keep track of my packages?
    answer: >-
      We are currently working on this functionality. This should be done by the
      end of Q1 2021. Stay tuned.
  - question: What are the consequences of package theft?
    answer: >-
      A police investigation & debt collection agency involvement. We will
      criminally prosecute any and all malicious users of the service.
  - question: I don't see my question on here. Who do I contact?
    answer: >-
      No problem! Contact us at <a href="#">support@borderlessparcel.com</a> and
      ask away.

faq:
  - question: 'How does this work, exactly?'
    answer: >-
      We will use your home address as the shipping address for our
      international shoppers. You'll ship the package to the shopper and get
      paid for it.
  - question: Why do shoppers use your service?
    answer: Idk.
  - question: What will I need to do this job?
    answer: 'Just a printer to print prepaid shipping labels, scissors, and tape.'
  - question: Is there a dashboard to keep track of my packages?
    answer: >-
      We are still in an early beta, but we've contacted a web development
      company to help build this functionality for us. Stay tuned.
  - question: Will I have to pay for shipping?
    answer: >-
      Never. Shipping costs will always be covered by us, so you don't have to
      worry about these costs.
  - question: How long does this job take?
    answer: >-
      30 minutes, or up to an hour per drop-off. You just have to receive the
      package(s), print off our prepaid shipping label, and call the local post
      office for pickup. Or, you can drive there and drop it off yourself if you
      prefer.
  - question: How come the pay is so high?
    answer: >-
      78% of our shoppers buy electronics. We pay our forwarders geneoursly so
      they do a good job of shipping and handling the package, as well as to
      prevent theft.
  - question: Can I check the contents of the package I'll be shipping?
    answer: >-
      Absolutely! All our items are shipped from major retailers such as
      Walmart, Target, Best Buy, etc. as well as major suppliers.
  - question: What are the consequences of package theft?
    answer: >-
      A police investigation & debt collection agency involvement. We will
      criminally prosecute any and all thieves (luckily, we haven't had to, so
      far)
  - question: I don't see my question on here. Who do I contact?
    answer: 'No problem! Contact us at <a href="#">support@borderlessparcel.com</a>.'
